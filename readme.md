# FinanceTrack
Welcome to the largest practice project I had ever built.

This program is a command-line tool that will allow you to mange your income and expenses.

Feel free to report any bugs you may find in this program. Please understand that I may never get around to fixing any of them, however.

You are also free to use this as a library. I have no idea if it'll be useful for that in any way (I'd say it certainly isn't), but it's all there and all documented!

This project is currently determined to be completed.
